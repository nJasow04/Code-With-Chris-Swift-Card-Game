# War Card Game - iOS App
## Project Overview
The War Card Game is my debut iOS application, marking my first foray into mobile app development for the iOS platform. This project was completed alongside a tutorial by Coding With Chris on YouTube, which provided a comprehensive guide and valuable insights throughout the development process.

## Technologies Used
- Xcode: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for building the iOS app.
- Swift: The programming language utilized for implementing the app's logic and functionality.
- iOS SDK: The software development kit provided by Apple for creating iOS applications.

## Project Description
The War Card Game is an engaging and interactive game where the player competes against a computer-controlled opponent (CPU). The objective is to flip a card with a randomly assigned value and compare it against the CPU's card. The player with the higher-valued card wins the round, and their point total is incremented accordingly. The game continues until a predetermined number of rounds or a specific winning condition is met.

## Key Features
- Random Card Generation: The app generates random card values for both the player and the CPU
- Score Tracking: The app keeps track of the player's and CPU's scores throughout the game
- User-friendly Interface: The app features an intuitive and visually appealing user interface

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout the development of the War Card Game, I gained valuable knowledge and skills in various aspects of iOS app development, including:
- Swift Programming: I acquired proficiency in the Swift programming language, learning its syntax, concepts, and best practices for iOS development.
- Xcode Proficiency: I became familiar with the Xcode IDE, leveraging its features and tools to efficiently develop and debug the app.
- iOS App Architecture: I gained an understanding of the fundamental architecture and components of an iOS app, including view controllers, storyboards, and app delegates.

## Future Progress
While the War Card Game serves as a solid foundation for my iOS development journey, there are several potential enhancements that could be explored in the future:
Realism: I guess I could make the game more realistic by making it so that there can be no draws as that would mean the player and the cpu had the same card which is technically not possible.
Multi-Page: I want to make it multi page perhaps, still don't know how to do that.
Leaderboards and Achievements: Integrate user's and backend perhaps? Still don't know how to do that with Swift, or really in general yet.
Sound Effects and Animations: Enhancing the visual and auditory experience by incorporating sound effects and animations during gameplay.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Coding With Chris for creating the comprehensive tutorial that guided me through the development of the War Card Game. Their clear explanations and step-by-step instructions were instrumental in my learning process and the successful completion of this project.
